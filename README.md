# JestSpec

Gherkin feature files for Jest.

This project is a re-imagining of Gherkin features for JavaScript, based on lessons learned from writing and consuming specification-based test libraries for many languages.

The project was started by copying the specifications from TypeSpec (which I wrote for TypeScript).

The idea is to use Jest to provide the test goodies, but allow Gherkin specifications to drive the tests.
